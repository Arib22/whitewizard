Science aside, you love hard and put others before your own needs. It’s time to give yourself the TLC you deserve. When was the last time you did something nice for yourself? Love Letter writing allows you to take a moment to pause, reflect, and appreciate how far you’ve come and even set goals for your future. We invite you to write yourself a Love Letter thanking yourself for all you have accomplished in the past 2 years and open it 2 months later. 

 

Take care of yourself so you can take care of the ones you love! Knowing that you took the time to write yourself a handwritten note will warm their heart and put a big smile on your face. Expressing gratitude in a handwritten note stirs up positive emotions and well-being for both the letter-writer and the receiver (aka YOU).
